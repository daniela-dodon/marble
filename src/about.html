                        The marble quarry from Rușchița, Caraș-Severin County, 
                        is located at a distance of 10 km from Rusca Montană commune. 
                        The marble extracted from Rușchița has different shades - from white, 
                        to gray, pink, reddish and yellow-pink

                        Cariera Veche - Gropan and Cariera Nouă - Dealul lui Ionel,
                        both located in the Poiana Ruscă Mountains,

                        Many important monuments were made of Rușchița marble, 
                        such as many buildings in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, such as the Palace of the Banks in Vienna. 
                        Also, the Cathedral of Milan was restored with Rușchița marble. 
                        In the United States, the famous eagle in the Oval Office of the White House was carved in marble from Rușchița.
