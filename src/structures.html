                                The Taj Mahal is a monument in the city of Agra,
                                India. It was built by Emperor Shah Jahan as a
                                mausoleum for his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The
                                building was built between 1630 and 1653.
                                Designed by Iranian architect Ustad Isa, the Taj
                                Mahal has become "the symbol of eternal love."
                                The building "rises" from the reddish landscape,
                                sitting on a white marble terrace that
                                highlights the huge dome and the four minarets.

                            <p>
                                The Leaning Tower of Pisa, also known as the
                                Leaning Tower of Pisa, is the most famous
                                leaning building in the world and the landmark
                                of the city of Pisa in Italy. It differs from
                                the usual square towers in central Italy and is
                                in stark contrast to the sharp towers in
                                northern Europe. It consists of 14,200 tons of
                                white Carrara marble and has seven bells, but
                                they have not been allowed to ring for a long
                                time due to the danger of collapse.

                                description in chapter 34 of Exodus in the

                                The Discobolus of Myron is a Greek sculpture
                                completed at the start of the Classical period,
                                figuring a youthful athlete throwing discus,
                                about 460–450 BC. The original Greek bronze is
                                lost but the work is known through numerous
                                Roman copies, both full-scale ones in marble,
                                which was cheaper than bronze, such as the first
                                to be recovered, the Palombara Discobolus, and
                                smaller scaled versions in bronze.
